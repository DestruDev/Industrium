# 🏭 Industrium (WIP)

**Industrium** is a 2D, tile-based building and automation prototype built in Unity.  
The project focuses on grid-aligned construction, item management, and early factory-style mechanics.

## 🎮 Current Features
- **2D character movement + animations**
- **Inventory system** with stackable items
- **Grid-based building system** for placing structures on tiles
- **In-game testing console** for spawning items and debugging behaviors
- **Basic structure placement logic** (snapping, validation, tile usage)

## 🧩 Gameplay Overview
You control a character who can explore the map, collect resources, and place down structures on a grid.  
The foundations of an automation-style loop are being built — inventory handling, tile interaction, and world systems.

## 🛠️ Current State
This is an active **work-in-progress** prototype.  
Systems are being added and refined as the core gameplay loop takes shape.

## 🧱 Tech & Tools
- **Unity (2D)**
- **C#**
- **Tilemap system**
- **Custom debugging / item spawning console**

## 🎨 Assets & Credits
This project currently uses prototype sprites, temporary assets, and developer-made placeholders.  
Final art and sound will be added later in development.
